        The count of comments on this node. It is important to note that this value is changed depending on the filter modifier being used (where comment replies are available):

        if filter is stream then total_count will be a count of all comments (including replies) on the node.
        if filter is toplevel then total_count will be a count of all top-level comments on the node.
        Note: total_count can be greater than or equal to the actual number of comments returned due to comment privacy or deletion.
